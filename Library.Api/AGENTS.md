# Agent Instructions

Read this entire file before starting any task.

## Self-Correcting Rules Engine

This file contains a growing ruleset that improves over time. **At session start, read the entire "Learned Rules" section before doing anything.**

## How it works

1. When the user corrects you or you make a mistake, **immediately append a new rule** to the "Learned Rules" section at the bottom of this file.
2. Rules are numbered sequentially and written as clear, imperative instructions.
3. Format: `N. [CATEGORY] Never/Always do X — because Y.`
4. Categories: `[STYLE]`, `[CODE]`, `[ARCH]`, `[TOOL]`, `[PROCESS]`, `[DATA]`, `[UX]`, `[OTHER]`
5. Before starting any task, scan all rules below for relevant constraints.
6. If two rules conflict, the higher-numbered (newer) rule wins.
7. Never delete rules. If a rule becomes obsolete, append a new rule that supersedes it.

## When to add a rule

- User explicitly corrects your output ("no, do it this way")
- User rejects a file, approach, or pattern
- You hit a bug caused by a wrong assumption about this codebase
- User states a preference ("always use X", "never do Y")

## Rule format example

```
14. [CODE] Always use `bun` instead of `npm` — user preference, bun is installed globally.
15. [STYLE] Never add emojis to commit messages — project convention.
16. [ARCH] API routes live in `src/server/routes/`, not `src/api/` — existing codebase pattern.
```

## Learned Rules

<!-- New rules are appended below this line. Do not edit above this section. -->

1. [STYLE] Keep comments minimal. Only write one when the *why* is non-obvious. Don't restate what the code does, don't narrate the current change, don't leave `// removed X` breadcrumbs. One short line max — no multi-line comment blocks or paragraph docstrings.
2. [STYLE] Never use em dashes anywhere in code, docs, or responses for this repo, because that is a user preference.
3. [ARCH] Always use noun-based, plural, consistent REST resource names such as `/api/books` and `/api/borrowings/{id}/return`, because the assessment requires clean resource naming.
4. [CODE] Always expose explicit request and response DTOs from API endpoints and never return EF Core entities directly, because API contracts must stay clear and decoupled from persistence models.
5. [CODE] Always use `201 Created` for creates, `200 OK` for successful reads, `200 OK` or `204 No Content` for updates, `204 No Content` for deletes, `400 Bad Request` for validation failures, `404 Not Found` for missing resources, and `409 Conflict` for duplicate or conflicting business states where appropriate, because status codes are part of the assessment criteria.
6. [CODE] Always return a consistent error payload with `statusCode`, `message`, and `traceId`, and include validation `errors` when applicable, because failure responses should be predictable.
7. [ARCH] Always keep endpoints thin and route business logic through application services and repository abstractions, because the expected flow is Endpoint -> Service -> Repository -> DbContext.
8. [ARCH] Always define repository interfaces and implementations for books, members, and borrowings, and never call `DbContext` directly from endpoints, because the repository pattern is required.
9. [ARCH] Always model domain behavior explicitly for actions such as borrowing and returning, because business rules should live in the domain or application layer instead of being scattered across endpoint handlers.
10. [CODE] Always validate every request model for required fields, formats, future dates, copy counts, duplicates, borrowing limits, and availability before mutating state, because validation coverage is a core assessment requirement.
11. [PROCESS] Always keep the solution aligned with the required stack and deliverables: .NET 10, Minimal APIs, EF Core, PostgreSQL via Docker, migrations, Swagger, README guidance, and seed data or setup instructions, because completeness is part of the assessment.
12. [PROCESS] Always add or update tests for important borrowing and return business rules when behavior changes, because those rules are explicitly called out in the assessment.
13. [UX] Always enable Swagger/OpenAPI and document endpoints, request models, response models, status codes where possible, and clear endpoint tags or names, because the API must be easy to inspect and test.
14. [PROCESS] Always follow the branch flow `main` -> `dev` -> `feature/*`, because changes should be developed on feature branches, reviewed by pull request, merged into `dev`, and promoted to `main` only when ready for release.
15. [PROCESS] Always create new work from `dev` and target pull requests back into `dev`, because the expected workflow is feature branch -> pull request -> `dev`.
16. [PROCESS] Never branch directly from `main` for normal feature work, and never open normal feature pull requests directly into `main`, because `main` should stay stable and release-ready.
17. [PROCESS] Always use descriptive branch names such as `feature/book-borrowing`, `fix/member-email-validation`, `chore/update-swagger-docs`, or `docs/readme-setup`, because branch purpose should be obvious at a glance.
18. [PROCESS] Always keep branch prefixes consistent by using `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, or `test/` as appropriate, because predictable naming improves team collaboration.
19. [STYLE] Always write commit messages in Conventional Commit style such as `feat: add borrowing return endpoint` or `fix: enforce unique member email`, because commit history should stay searchable and consistent.
20. [STYLE] Always keep the commit subject concise, imperative, and lowercase, and never end it with a period, because clean commit subjects are easier to scan.
